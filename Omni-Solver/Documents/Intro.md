The prevailing structure of contemporary digital asset markets inherently favors insiders due to the isolated nature of spot market mechanisms. This isolation systematically generates information-based arbitrage opportunities exploitable primarily by those possessing advanced or exclusive informational and technical access—broadly categorized as insiders. Such insiders, encompassing influential Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs), technically sophisticated actors (including MEV operators), and project infrastructure providers, benefit disproportionately through early participation, leveraging their privileged positions to extract maximal economic value. Consequently, non-insider market participants, especially ethical founders and retail investors, face structural disadvantages stemming from delayed market entry and restricted opportunities. This structural imbalance incentivizes ethically questionable behaviors among founders, promoting token launches designed primarily to amplify insider gains. The introduction of a theoretically generalized financial infrastructure, termed here as the "Omni-Solver," capable of synthesizing perpetual derivatives from any underlying asset, presents a transformative solution to this hidden problem, modfying the currently existing nash equilibrium by providing ethical participants with more financial tools to counter-balance the current predominately favoring of unethical players through subtle mechanics. By democratizing access to derivative instruments, the Omni-Solver aims to neutralize the asymmetric advantages currently enjoyed by insiders, mitigate the influence of isolated spot market information asymmetry, and ultimately foster equitable market participation and efficiency.

## Key Players in Cryptocurrency: A Game-Theoretical Discourse

Cryptocurrency markets are dynamically influenced by a diverse set of actors whose interactions and incentives can be effectively analyzed through the lens of game theory. Central to these interactions are four principal categories of participants: Retail Traders, Founders, Whales/Market Makers, and Infrastructure Providers.

### Traders, Retail
Retail traders generally exhibit behaviors characterized by limited information and capital resources, positioning them as reactive rather than proactive market participants. Their strategic disadvantage lies in their delayed information access and inability to influence market movements significantly. Consequently, they often serve as liquidity providers or follow-on investors, indirectly benefiting insiders who exploit informational asymmetries.

### Founders (Ethical & Non-Ethical)
Founders significantly shape market dynamics through their choices regarding transparency, token distribution, and market engagement strategies. Ethical founders emphasize equitable token distribution and transparent operations, often facing market penalties due to delayed initial capitalization and diminished speculative appeal. Conversely, non-ethical founders exploit insider-driven incentives, leveraging early information dissemination and preferential token allocation strategies to maximize personal and insider financial returns.

### Whales/Market Makers (Insiders & Non-Insiders)
Whales represent powerful market entities capable of substantial asset movements and price manipulation. Insider whales benefit from privileged early access to market-critical information and strategic positioning, facilitating optimal arbitrage opportunities. Non-insider whales, while influential due to their significant capital, face comparative disadvantages in accessing exclusive insights but maintain considerable power through sheer scale and liquidity provision capabilities.

### Ethical & Non-Ethical Assistants (Infrastructure, KOLs, MEV-bots)
Infrastructure providers and technologically adept actors significantly impact market fairness and efficiency. Ethical assistants uphold market integrity through transparent operational practices and open dissemination of tools and information. In contrast, non-ethical assistants, including opportunistic KOLs and malicious MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) operators, strategically exploit their technological prowess and influence to capitalize on market inefficiencies and amplify informational asymmetries.

## Structural Advantages of Isolated Spot Markets

The isolated nature of current cryptocurrency spot markets inherently favors insiders, especially non-ethical participants, by creating abundant arbitrage opportunities. With infinite, zero-cost listings of isolated spot assets, non-ethical founders and insider whales benefit substantially from early informational and technical advantages. Insiders leverage their priority access to initiate and manipulate asset prices, exploiting subsequent retail-driven momentum and liquidity. Ethical founders, bound by transparency and fair distribution constraints, are systematically disadvantaged, unable to capitalize swiftly on initial speculative fervor. Retail traders and non-insider whales, entering later, face significant structural impediments due to their reactive positions, often serving as exit liquidity for insiders. Non-ethical infrastructure providers and KOLs further amplify these asymmetries by facilitating rapid asset listings and disseminating selectively favorable information, enhancing the profitability of insiders while deepening structural inequities within the market. Ultimately, the current isolated spot market environment perpetuates systemic bias favoring non-ethical behavior, underscoring the necessity of innovative solutions like the Omni-Solver to rebalance market dynamics.

## Market Demand for Relaunch & Rebrand

Given current market dynamics favoring early entrants, ethical founders increasingly adopt strategies of relaunching and rebranding their projects to rejuvenate interest and attract fresh investment. The low barrier and minimal cost associated with launching isolated spot assets significantly incentivize such strategic pivots. This approach, although typically beneficial to non-ethical founders who exploit these mechanisms repeatedly, has become a necessary tool even for ethical actors aiming to revitalize legitimate but stagnating projects. Relaunches and rebrands effectively reset investor perception, generate new speculative interest, and offer ethical founders a second opportunity to communicate their value proposition clearly, fostering renewed market participation and competitive viability.

A notable example of a successful rebranding is the transformation of the Fantom blockchain into Sonic. Following its rebrand in January 2025, Sonic experienced a significant surge in Total Value Locked (TVL), surpassing $\$1$ billion and positioning itself as a major player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. This growth underscores the potential effectiveness of rebranding strategies in revitalizing blockchain projects.

## Structural Market Stability and the Role of New Financial Tools

Historically, structural changes in financial markets have been catalyzed significantly by the advent of innovative financial tools and methodologies. The introduction of the Black-Scholes formula revolutionized options pricing in traditional financial markets, dramatically improving market liquidity, efficiency, and fairness. Similarly, contemporary cryptocurrency markets remain structurally static without innovative financial instruments.

Currently, there is significant incentive to become an insider, adopt non-ethical strategies, or engage in manipulative tactics such as KOL marketing and artificial scarcity. The spot-only environment substantially enhances the value of being first, amplifying insiders' capacity for maximum value extraction. Without advanced financial tools akin to Black-Scholes, digital asset markets will likely persist in favoring those who prioritize unethical strategies to gain early access advantages. The Omni-Solver represents an essential advancement, capable of disrupting these entrenched incentives and fostering fair, equitable, and dynamically stable market conditions.
