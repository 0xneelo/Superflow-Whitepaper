## Mathematical Models

This whitepaper presents five mathematical models that analyze market inefficiencies in token launches and propose solutions:

1. **Model 1**: Analysis of insider trading advantages during token launches
2. **Model 2**: Detailed examination of timing and information advantages
3. **Model 3**: Investigation of pre-launch preparation advantages
4. **Model 4**: Analysis of isolated spot markets and synthetic asset solutions
5. **Model 5**: Comprehensive mathematical derivation of insider advantage and market equilibrium restoration
