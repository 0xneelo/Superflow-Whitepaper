Superflow is developing a comprehensive decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, leveraging decades of combined research and industry experience. The project aims to become a DeFi powerhouse by integrating several key components: an innovative **Omni-Solver** (built on Symmio) to address market inefficiencies using synthetic derivatives, an Intent-Based and CLOB **Perpetual Exchange** as Meta-Solver ontop of Symmio, an **Options Platform** utilizing Symmio Intents. By combining these elements, Superflow seeks to offer a robust and versatile suite of tools for advanced trading and market participation.
