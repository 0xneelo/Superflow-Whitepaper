# Section 3 - Extended Mathematical Model: Pre-Launch Advantage for Insiders

## Step 0: Define Pre-Launch Time (t₋ₙ)

**t₋ₙ**: The period before token launch (t₀), where insiders have exclusive knowledge of:

- Exact token details (identity, contract address, legitimacy)
- Exact timing of launch (precise t₀)
- Expected demand and anticipated token appreciation post-launch

Insiders use this period for strategic preparation.

## Step 1: Insider Advantage during Pre-launch (t₋ₙ)

Insiders gain two distinct advantages in the pre-launch period:

### Advantage A: Financial Preparation

Insiders allocate significant capital beforehand.

Define Cₐ as the amount of capital insiders prepare at t₋ₙ:

Cₐ(t₋ₙ) ≫ 0

### Advantage B: Psychological Advantage (Reduced Stress & Increased Rationality)

Insiders experience lower psychological stress due to certainty and preparation.

- Rationality factor (Rₐ ≈ 1): Insiders behave near-optimally
- Thus, insiders' expected decision quality at launch is optimal:

E[Dₐ(t₀)] ≈ Optimal

## Step 2: Outsider Disadvantage (Surprise and FOMO)

Outsiders discover the token at time t₀ + N, and face:

### No Pre-launch Preparation

Capital available is uncertain and limited at the moment of discovery:

Cₒ(t₀ + N) ≪ Cₐ(t₋ₙ)

### Psychological Distress (Surprise & FOMO)

- Rationality factor (Rₒ ≪ 1): Outsiders behave suboptimally due to stress, panic buying (FOMO), and irrational decision-making
- Thus, outsiders' expected decision quality is poor:

E[Dₒ(t₀ + N)] ≪ Optimal

## Step 3: Formalizing FOMO and Irrationality

Define a behavioral utility function that incorporates psychological stress:

### Insider Behavioral Utility (Uₐ)

Uₐ = Rₐ · (Qₐ · [P(t₀ + N) - P(t₀ + δ)])

where:
- Rₐ ≈ 1 (rational decision-making)
- Qₐ is capital deployed (highly optimal)

### Outsider Behavioral Utility (Uₒ)

Uₒ = Rₒ · (Qₒ · [P(t₀ + N') - P(t₀ + N)])

where:
- Rₒ ≪ 1 (suboptimal decisions)
- Qₒ is irrationally deployed capital due to FOMO

Given the psychological factor, we observe clearly:

Uₐ ≫ Uₒ

## Step 4: Real-world Example (Libra Launch Revisited)

### Insiders

**Pre-launch preparation (t₋ₙ):**
- Calm, informed, allocated $1,000,000 ready to deploy instantly at launch
- Rationality factor Rₐ = 0.99

### Outsiders

**Discovery at t₀ + N (e.g., 1 hour post-launch):**
- Unprepared, stressed, FOMO-driven
- Panic-buying with only $50,000 accessible instantly, at inflated price
- Rationality factor Rₒ = 0.4

### Utility Comparison

**Insiders:**
Uₐ = 0.99 × ($1,000,000 × [0.10 - 0.02]) = $792,000

**Outsiders:**
Uₒ = 0.4 × ($50,000 × [0.08 - 0.10]) = -$400

## Step 5: Integrating into the Timeline (Extended)

### Updated Comprehensive Timeline

1. **t₋ₙ**: Insider exclusive preparation period (financial/psychological advantage)
2. **t₀**: Token launch (tradable publicly, insiders instantly participate)
3. **t₀ + δ**: Insider exclusive trading window (1-10 min)
4. **t₀ + N**: Public awareness begins; outsiders react irrationally (FOMO)

### Formal Comprehensive Insider Advantage

1. **Financial capital:**
   Cₐ(t₋ₙ) ≫ Cₒ(t₀ + N)

2. **Rationality/optimality:**
   Rₐ(t₋ₙ) ≫ Rₒ(t₀ + N)

Thus, insiders possess overwhelming structural advantages mathematically proven to facilitate unethical behavior.

## Conclusion

Explicitly including pre-launch preparation mathematically emphasizes insiders' advantages in terms of:

1. **Capital availability**
2. **Mental preparation and rational decision-making**

This structural inequity intensifies the already-existing informational asymmetries, systematically disadvantaging outsiders and incentivizing unethical insider strategies.

Your proposed solution (Omni-Solver) could theoretically neutralize this pre-launch advantage by offering transparent derivatives and eliminating the necessity for insider-only knowledge and preparation.
